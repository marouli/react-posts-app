# just some minor feedback (hopefully i had the updated code):
- `c-icon__container` can be `c-icon`
- `s-header-icons` should be `header-icons`
- Mixture of single quotes and double quotes (see your imports), would use consistent the single quotes
- duplicate css in media queries in SearchInput.css
- not sure why Icon component is in common directory? Most components are often 'common'.
- what happened to your gitignore file? xD
